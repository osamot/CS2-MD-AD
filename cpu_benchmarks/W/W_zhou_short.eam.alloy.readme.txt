(*) Modification: Compared to the publicly available references above,
we modified the file in the following ways: We changed the cut-off
radius to 5.524750 A. We maintained only every 20'th point of each
function table, starting with the first. That means we had 501 points
in the tables as opposed to 10001 in the original file.
